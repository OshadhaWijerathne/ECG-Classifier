          <h1>Cardiovascular Diseases </h1>
          <p>
            Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) pose a significant global health
            challenge, claiming millions of lives each year. Early and accurate
            detection of CVDs is critical for improving outcomes. These diseases
            encompass a range of disorders affecting the heart and blood
            vessels, including coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease,
            rheumatic heart disease, and more. Shockingly, over four out of five
            CVD-related deaths result from heart attacks and strokes, with a
            third of these fatalities occurring prematurely in individuals under
            70 years of age. Key behavioral risk factors, including unhealthy
            diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and harmful alcohol
            consumption, significantly contribute to heart disease and stroke.

          <h1>ECG Signal</h1>
          <p>
            An electrocardiogram (ECG) signal is a window into the heart's
            electrical activity, consisting of a series of distinct components
            that hold valuable diagnostic information.These components,
            including the P-wave, QRS complex, and T-wave, represent different
            phases of the cardiac cycle. The P-wave reflects atrial
            depolarization, the QRS complex represents ventricular
            depolarization, and the T-wave signifies ventricular repolarization.
            Understanding these components and their subtle variations is
            fundamental in diagnosing cardiac conditions. These ECG signals are
            essential for the early detection of cardiovascular abnormalities.

          <h1>About Our Web App</h1>
          <p>
            Our web app employs advanced technologies, including Convolutional
            Neural Network (CNN), to analyze ECG signals for accurate diagnosis.
            In addition to ECG data, we also incorporate patient age and sex
            data to enhance our diagnostic capabilities. We utilize datasets
            from the PhysioNet website, containing normal and arrhythmia ECG
            data. These raw ECG signals and demographic information undergo
            preprocessing to facilitate the training of our classifiers, which
            distinguish normal from abnormal ECG data. By harnessing these
            advanced techniques and CNN, our web app contributes to improved ECG
            classification accuracy, ultimately aiding in the early diagnosis of
            cardiovascular diseases.
